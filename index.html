        <article><h1>keylogger-mvp README</h1>
<p>This keylogger allows for users to input their keystrokes for research purposes.
Once the new VSCode window has opened a user will open the Command Palette and type
'Start Testing'. Once the user does this they will be prompted to enter their email.
After the email is validated as being correct they will be told to select the
language they wish to code in. They will then be prompted to choose a problem set.
After that the extension will begin recording the user's actions and the user will
be able to see their problem question and how many tests they are passing. Once they
finish they will open the Command Palette and type in 'Stop Testing'. Once this is complete
the user will be prompted to copy the link to a survey and fill out it out in browser.</p>
